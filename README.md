# Windows Userland SVC Demo
This is an experiment I put together one afternoon to call SVCs on Windows.
There is a dependency on NTDLL only for initialization of SVC numbers.
It is unfinished, will likely not be finished, might not work on your computer, and is not meant for general use.
It is a torn out test library from a much larger library.

Developed and built on Windows using GCC 11.2 and make from MSYS2.
Thank you to Atmosph√®re which I used part of as a base for the define utilities.
